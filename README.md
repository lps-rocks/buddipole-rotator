# buddipole-rotator

Inspired by [the rotator made by KI6AWR and HB9MTN](https://qsl.net/hb9mtn/BPMW/MW_Rotor.html), this rotator adds some additional features and makes some design changes. All of the rotator intelligence is located in the rotator at the mast and exposes an RS485 connection with the [Idiom Press Rotor-EZ Rotator Control Protocol](https://www.hamsupply.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rotor-EZ-Protocol.pdf).

I've split this into a few independent designs and parts

- Rotator
- Controller
- Wireless Module

## Rotator 

### Features
- Utilizes [Idiom Press Rotor-EZ Rotator Control Protocol](https://www.hamsupply.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rotor-EZ-Protocol.pdf) over Full Duplex RS-485 via 5-pin 16mm aviation connector
- Trinamic TMC2130 Stepper driver can intelligently adjust power output to the stepper based on load to prevent lost steps, maximize motor torque, reduce power consumption, and heat output
- Can operate off of wide voltage range
- 1Â° rotation increments
  
### Design
- Arduino Code - Link to Arduino Source Code
- Schematic - Link to Schematic
- Board - Link to board
- STL files - Link to STL files
